for the primary analytical strategy, neither estimate nor 
variance differed. The total sample size producing this 
summary estimate was 34,719 (Table 1). 
Fewer articles and estimates were available for 
the diagnostic sensitivity analyses. For the sensitivity 
analysis based on 35 estimates (sample size of 9,446 
obtained from 5 articles) that did not distinguish be-
tween IgG and IgM results, seropositivity was 14.5% 
(95% CI 11.8%17.2%). For the sensitivity analysis 
that used a 2-tier testing system (16 estimates ob-
tained from 6 articles with a sample size of 8,837), se-
ropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 0.9%2.7%) (Table 1).
Seropositivity for the clinical suspicion sample was 
7.1% (95% CI 6.4%8.0%). Lyme disease seropositiv-
ity estimates by exposure risk populations were 4.5% 
(95% CI 3.9%5.1%) for low risk, 6.1% (95% CI 5.4%
6.7%) for medium risk, and 10.0% (95% CI 9.6%10.4%) 
for high risk (Table 1). The odds ratio of high exposure 
risk seropositivity compared with low exposure risk 
seropositivity was 2.4 (95% CI 2.12.7) and of moderate 
exposure risk seropositivity compared with low expo-
sure risk seropositivity was 1.4 (95% CI 1.21.6).
Variation by province was substantial; the high-
est seropositivity estimates were 23.1% for Heilongji-
ang Province and 16.2% for Neimenggu (Inner Mon-
golia) Province (Figure 2). Moreover, variation across 
provinces was substantial (Figure 3). There was no 
discernable trend over time for seropositivity (data 
not shown).
Discussion
Our systematic literature review of B. burgdorferi se-
ropositivity in China generated summary estimates 
by diagnostic test, exposure risk, sex, age group, 
province, and year. Depending on the testing algo-
rithm applied, the seropositivity ranged from 1.8% to 
14.5%, reflecting Lyme disease endemicity in the pop-
ulation. Combined with the widespread distribution 
of Ixodes ticks, specifically I. persulcatus ticks in many 
provinces, this analysis reinforces that Lyme disease 
is a public health problem in China.
The summary estimates of 9.1% among EIA/IFA 
positive samples and 1.8% among samples confirmed 
with WB fell within the range identified in Europe. In 
Germany, the nationwide, population-based cross-
sectional KiGGS study estimated seropositivity among 
children and adolescents of 4.8% by single-tier ELISA 
testing (4% when confirmed by line blot) (14). A similar 
nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study 
among adults in Germany (DEGS) reported overall 
seropositivity of 9.4%, confirmed by line blot (15). A 
cross-sectional health survey among a representative 
sample of adults in Finland reported seropositivity of 
3.9% according to 2-tier testing (16). A representative 
sample of healthy blood donors from the Tyrol region 
of Austria reported a seropositivity range of 1.5%7.2% 
from samples confirmed by line blot (17). A regional 
study in Turkey among healthy volunteers revealed 
seropositivity of 4.1% by single-tier testing with ELISA 
and 2.2% confirmed by WB (18).
In China, results of the diagnostic sensitivity 
analyses were consistent with expectations based on 
Lyme diagnostic testing limitations. Several studies 
did not adequately delineate the results by IgM or 
IgG positivity, and this joint numerator resulted in a 
substantially higher estimate than IgG seropositivity

respondents were likely or very likely to get vaccinated against 
LD. Our study, however, found that 60% of adults and 71% of care-
givers were likely or very likely to get vaccinated against LD if a 
vaccine were available. Differences across study samples could 
account for some of the variations in vaccine intention estimates. 
Our respondents were drawn from a broader population (i.e.all 16 
endemic states), whereas respondents from both Hook, Hansen, 
etal.(2022) and Niesobecki et	al.(2019) were exclusively from 
a select few endemic states. In addition to broader coverage, 
our quota-	based sampling technique led to a more representa-
tive group of respondents. For example, 23% of the Adult sam-
ple and 36% of the Caregiver sample reported income of greater 
than $100,000, while 53% of the respondents in Niesobecki 
etal.(2019) reported an income greater than $100,000. While 
the specific relationship between LD vaccination intention and 
income is not well studied, higher median household income has 
been found to be associated with higher community COVID-	19 
vaccination rates (Masterson etal.,2023	).
Shadick etal.(2016), which applied the HBM to educational ini-
tiatives for LD, found that educational programmes that included el-
ements of awareness and knowledge of LD, benefits of preventative 
behaviour, and self-	efficacy can improve knowledge, attitude and 
self-	reported precautionary behaviour among at-	risk children. While 
their study methodology and scope differ from ours, the importance 
of perceived benefits in preventative behaviour aligns with our find-
ings. Jacob et al.(2019), which used an HBM focused on LD pre-
vention at the municipal level, found that barriers to implementing 
preventive interventions moderated the intention-	implementation 
relationship, suggesting that while barriers may not be significant 
predictors of intention to vaccinate, they could become significant 
predictors of whether a person would follow through on receiving 
a vaccine.
While our study contributes to the growing literature on LD and 
drivers of vaccination uptake, we acknowledge the study's limita-
tions. Although we implemented quotas to ensure that the demo-
graphics of the sample would approximate those of the underlying 
population and distributed the survey through a panel that has 
shown to be demographically representative of the United States 
(Boas et al.,2020), the final sample slightly oversampled respon-
dents who identified as White.

 Survey panels more broadly may 
also have inherent limitations, which includes the tendency for panel 
members to be more educated than non-	panel members (Callegaro 
etal.,2014; Hays et al.,2015). Moreover, while we found the HBM 
to be a strong framework to identify key drivers associated with 
vaccination intention, we acknowledge that it does not capture all 
factors associated with vaccination intention (e.g. socioeconomic 
status, ethnicity, education level). Lastly, the question on the inten-
tion to vaccinate was for a generic LD vaccine and not specific to 
a vaccine with defined attributes (e.g. schedule, efficacy, safety), 
and therefore may either underestimate or overestimate intention 
for a future vaccine. Regardless, the data and study indicate the 
importance of ongoing research on LD vaccination uptake. Future 
renditions of similar research may consider conducting HBMs with

You're referring to Alpha, a measure of internal consistency developed by Lee J. Cronbach!

Cronbach's Alpha is a statistical measure that calculates the reliability of a test or scale based on its internal structure. The estimate varies depending on several factors, including:

1. **Number of items**: More items generally lead to higher Alpha values.
2. **Item difficulty**: Items with similar difficulties tend to increase Alpha.
3. **Item overlap**: Overlapping item content can boost Alpha.
4. **Test length**: Longer tests often have lower Alpha values due to increased measurement error.

Here are some general guidelines for interpreting Cronbach's Alpha estimates:

* **Alpha > 0.9**: Very high reliability; the test or scale is highly consistent and reliable.
* **Alpha = 0.8-0.89**: High reliability; the test or scale is generally consistent, but with some minor inconsistencies.
* **Alpha = 0.7-0.79**: Moderate reliability; the test or scale has some inconsistencies, but still provides a reasonable measure of what it's supposed to measure.
* **Alpha = 0.6-0.69**: Low reliability; the test or scale is prone to errors and inconsistent measurements.
* **Alpha < 0.6**: Very low reliability; the test or scale is unreliable and may not be a good measure of what it's supposed to measure.

Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and the interpretation of Alpha values depends on the specific context and research question being investigated. It's always a good idea to consult with a statistician or researcher familiar with your field to better understand how to interpret Cronbach's Alpha estimates for your particular study.
